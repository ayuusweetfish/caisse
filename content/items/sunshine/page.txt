2019 CiGA Game Jam 队伍“雨中冒险”作品。
一只吸血鬼与无法触及的心上人的故事。严格意义上确实是一个百合游戏（x）。
当人们奔向自己的理想时，会不会有想象之外的事情悄悄发生在世界的另一面呢？

未来动漫・游戏技术兴趣团队组队参加的 game jam。游戏的引擎版本有些年代了，当时发布的版本也没有留存，所以只放了视频和程序仓库。
冒雨前往现场，略作等待后就到了主题揭晓的时刻——主题是这张漫画。

后来我们决定打车返回学校，大家在车上都想了很多，但是都没有完整的想法，一度考虑过弃赛，直到第二天白天才确定故事——不能碰到阳光的隐居吸血鬼，面对破旧居所被拆掉用于建设公园的无奈。
然后不知道怎么就被推上了关卡策划的位置，有点慌！不过有另一位好圆同学一起所以安心了许多。到了第二天的晚上（还剩大半天）就在活动室无聊地晃悠了，这就是压榨劳动力的策划生活吗！（不是）
后来实在对不住良心跑去现学现卖 Unity 帮忙做了一点程序。最终展示出来感觉相当棒！赞美社团各路神仙们。

四舍五入还是程序（为什么没贴照片还是要煞有介事地抹几笔呢？我也记不得了。

Entry of the team “Risk of Rain” to the 2019 CiGA Game Jam.
A story of a vampire and her untouchable beloved. Technically it is indeed a girls’ love game.
As people run towards their ideals, will something beyond their imagination be quietly going on, on the other side of the world?

A teamed game jam with the Future ACG Group. The game engine has become a bit dated and the version produced for the jam has not been kept, so only the video and the repository have been put up.
Having travelled through the rain to the venue, we didn’t wait long before the theme was revealed — this cartoon.

We then decided to take a taxi back to school. Everyone pondered a lot in the cars but none of us had a complete idea. At one point we even considered quitting, and it was only until the following morning that we settled on a narrative — the reclusive vampire vulnerable to sunlight, and her helplessness facing the demolition of her crumbling residence for the construction of a park.
Then, for some reason, I was assigned the role of puzzle design, which put me in a flustered mood. To my relief, there was a teammate Haoyuan doing it together with me. By the night of the second day (with more than half of a day left for the jam) I was already wandering with boredom in our studio. Is this the life of a designer who exploit labour…?

Rounding off, I was still a programming member. I do not recall the reason for the masks despite there not being an actual photo.
