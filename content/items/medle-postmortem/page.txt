!<h1 鸡尾酒里的小石子 #cocktail>

不知从什么时候起，时间好像被划成了一小格一小格，我乘着列车走过这圈长长的水槽，在每个格子里倒入彩色的颜料，调成生活的鸡尾酒——更重要的是，在最后放上一块雕刻过的、染上花色的石子。

!<img medle-01.png <= > syncdark>

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-02.png <= > syncdark>

这颗石子叫 Medle。它有个中文名字“谜谜之音”，但是大家喜欢叫它麦兜。每天一个旋律谜题，陪伴了我二十二岁的每一天，也陪伴不多不少的玩家消磨了些许时光。

!<hr cloudy>

我是经常被写在谜题最后的那个 Ayu。

!<img medle-03.png <= > syncdark>

有的时候，我觉得自己像是神话里的那个西西弗斯——贴着午夜的脚步声按下回车键、长出一口气，今天游戏还是没倒闭；但是一切不过是又回到起点罢了，这份工作好像一眼望不到头。

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-04.png <= > syncdark>

有的时候，我觉得自己因为这些数字和彩色圆圈变得十分疲惫。但是，我可不愿就这么停下来呀。

!<hr cloudy>

想着大家在这里近距离触碰音乐的快乐与感悟，想着它获得的这个世界的那么多的爱——

!<img medle-05.png <= > syncdark>

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-06.png <= > syncdark>

我要让它继续和我一起，一天天地长大。

!<hr cloudy>

但我终究只是个碌碌凡人，没有西西弗斯的永生。今天，我想我完成了我的使命。

!<img medle-07.png <= > syncdark>

牵着它的手走到这里，接下来的路我只要远远看着它前行就好啦。

!<h1 七夕与雪花 #tanabata-snowflakes>

<link medle “%”>在今天和我一起度过了生日。此后我不会再为它添上新的题目——所谓周年，就是将时间绕成一圈一圈；每天它的模样都如一年前。这样，它就能在每一位玩家的初遇，展开独属于对方的一整年。

这一切的开端还要从去年寒假在家时说起。那时我想着能不能用音乐里的“和声”概念来制作谜题，但是后来由于易学性与游戏性之间很难找到平衡，就作罢了。后来到了学校，在艺术团训练期间有了旋律猜谜的想法，于是趁着排练间隙做出了整个游戏。

游戏里的第一个谜题是《七夕》，它也是正式游戏中第 165 天的谜题。这是一位日本作曲家创作的管乐曲，描绘的是自己对高中管乐队恋恋不舍的情怀。这首当时正在排练的曲子深得我心，于是它就成了测试阶段的专用曲，也是交给乐队伙伴们内测的第一个谜题。

我甚至考虑过是不是要每天扒一份缩谱、然后用钢琴音色放出声，与游戏中的钢琴声音更贴合，更易于从游戏中学习听辨。幸好后来扒完这一首就放弃了，不然得累趴下。

!<img 001.svg 《七夕》乐曲片段的缩谱。 syncdark caption>

那次训练汇报演出的第二天恰逢北京冬奥会闭幕，因此节目中有一首器乐与合唱演绎的奥运主题曲《雪花》，优美动听，打动了台下的我。于是两天后游戏开幕的谜题就选择了这首歌。

!<h1 串烧曲 #medley>

我尽力顾及了不同风格、时代、地域、作者与演绎者的音乐，也基本不会拒稿；毕竟音乐虽是世界的语言，却也有许多许多的方言，绽放着各异的色彩。

渐渐地，这个游戏有了一些分支，即使我一直没有写完详细的说明，大家也摸索着创造了各自的谜题。它甚至启发了两个新的小游戏：程序代码猜谜 <link https://codle.ouuan.moe/ Codle> 与和弦猜谜 <link https://43.138.56.99/chordle Chordle>。

我一直在一小群认识的友人之间收集投稿，每次收到都会由衷地感到开心、感激。曾经想过开辟一个在线留言板来收集投稿；现有的平台总有些不太合适的地方，因此我自己编写了程序，但是由于极端的完美主义最后没有上线。算是一个小小的遗憾啦。

要怎么结束呢？当我在半年前的夏天告诉一位好友时，她说觉得好可惜，希望我一直做下去。在这一瞬间我有些小小的感动——可是，我毕竟不是机器人呀。我也没有太想把它推广到多远的地方，就这样平平淡淡度过一年，已经是很棒的经历了。

前些日子我想过制作一个小游戏来接替它——我想过<link 28-days-22w#day-24 用 AI 制作音乐游戏地图>，想过歌单猜歌小游戏（这个还是某天梦里想出来的），想过通过算法的辅助让没有学习过的大家也能共同创作音乐，也一直保留着最早的想法：做个“Medle Medley”，把出现过的乐曲选择一些拼接在一起，编写一首混成曲。但是我的工作能力没有那么厉害，时间精力也都有限，几番纠结与挣扎后只好作罢，选择用这篇废话来作结。尽管如此，这些想法说不定之后有一天也会和大家见面呢！

!<h1 尾声 #coda>

Medle 的路还要继续走下去，它当然也不会是我最后一次尝试做与音乐相关的小玩意。但还是要在这里谢谢每一位玩家，谢谢你们每一次在这里触碰的音符与旋律。
音乐是属于所有人的。如果愿意的话，请尽情地去倾听、去触摸，去喜爱、去挑剔，去评论、去制造。再让我听到“我不懂乐理”我会伤心的 ok？

!<h1 Pebbles in Cocktails #cocktail>

Since some point, time seemed to be divided into little cubicles. I ride a train through this long swirl of sinks, pouring coloured paint into each cubicle, mixing the cocktail of life — and more importantly, finishing by putting in a meticulously carved, flower-stained pebble.

!<img medle-01.png <= > syncdark>

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-02.png <= > syncdark>

The pebble is named Medle. A puzzle of melody for each day — these have been accompanying me through my entire twenty-second year in this world, as well as a few hours for a handful of players.

!<hr cloudy>

I am the Ayu, signed at the end of many puzzles.

!<img medle-03.png <= > syncdark>

There are times when I feel like Sisyphus in the myths — pressing the enter button against the midnight footsteps, breathing a sigh of relief that the game is still alive today; but everything just comes back to square one. The job seems endless.

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-04.png <= > syncdark>

There are times when I feel exhausted from all these digits and coloured bubbles. But I did not want to stop.

!<hr cloudy>

Thinking of the joy and inspiration everyone has found from the intimate contact of music here, of the abundant love it has received from the world —

!<img medle-05.png <= > syncdark>

!<hr cloudy>

!<img medle-06.png <= > syncdark>

I want to take it with me and grow up together, day by day.

!<hr cloudy>

But at the end of the day, I am just a bumbling mortal, unlike Sisyphus with the eternal life. Today, I think I have fulfilled my duty.

!<img medle-07.png <= > syncdark>

Holding its hand this far, I will stay and watch it walk the journey ahead.

!<h1 Tanabata and Snowflakes #tanabata-snowflakes>

<link medle %> had its birthday with me together today. I will no longer add new puzzles to it — an anniversary, in Chinese, “周年”, means to revolve around for a year; for Medle, each day it gets back to the same point as a year ago. In this way, it can unfold a unique whole year at each player’s first encounter.

It all started when I was at home during the winter holidays last year. I thought I could use the concept of harmony in music to create puzzle games, but I had a hard time finding a balance between learnability and playability, and finally gave up. Later when I had been at school, I had the idea for melody puzzles during the art troupe’s training days and created the game in between rehearsals.

The game’s first puzzle ever was “Tanabata”, which went on to be the puzzle for day 165 in the game. It is a piece for the wind band composed by a Japanese composer, depicting the composer’s love with the high school wind band. This piece, which was being rehearsed at the time, was so close to my heart that it became the exclusive music during development and the first puzzle given to the friends in the band for playtesting.

I even considered the possibility of transcribing a condensed score every day and playing it out with piano sounds, in order to match the sounds during puzzle solving and make it more likely to learn to listen from the game. I was lucky to have given up, otherwise I would have already been exhausted.

!<img 001.svg <= Condensed score for an excerpt from “Tanabata”.> syncdark caption>

The day after the final performance coincided with the closing of the Beijing Winter Olympics, so the programme included a beautiful instrumental and choral rendition of the Olympic theme song “Snowflakes” that moved me. The music was then chosen for the puzzle that opened the games two days later.

!<h1 Medley #medley>

I did my best to absorb the different styles, eras, regions, authors and performers of the music, and have rejected few puzzle proposals; after all, despite music being the language of the world, there are many, many dialects that blossom in various colours.

The game spawned forks. Even though I never finished writing detailed instructions, people have managed to their own puzzles. It even inspired two new games: puzzles of code, <link https://codle.ouuan.moe/ Codle>, and puzzles of chords in music, <link https://43.138.56.99/chordle Chordle>.

I’ve been collecting puzzle proposals from a small group of friends, and I tingle with genuine delight and gratefulness every time I receive one. I thought about opening an online message board to collect proposals; existing platform didn’t match the use case, so I wrote my own program, but due to extreme perfectionism it never went live. It’s a bit of a regret.

How will it end? When I told a close friend about it in the summer half a year, she said she felt regretful for that and wanted me to keep the game going. I was touched at the moment — but I could not be a robot. Neither did I really want to take it too far; it has been a great experience to just get through a year uneventfully.

Recently I’ve been thinking about creating a new game to take over — I thought about <link 28-days-22w#day-24 making maps in musical or rhythmic games with AI>, about puzzles revealing a track in a playlist (the idea of which came to me in a dream), about collaboration in making music with the aid of an algorithm for people without experience, about my earliest idea: a “Medle Medley”, where a selection of music in the game are mixed together into a new piece. But I’m cumbersome at my work, and my time and energy are limited as well, hence after a few days of hesitation and struggles I had to give up and choose to take a curtain call with this nonsense. Nonetheless, these ideas may be brought to life someday in the future!

!<h1 Coda #coda>

Medle’s path continues and it certainly will not be my last attempt at making music-related stuff. But still, I would like to thank everyone here, for every note and melody you have touched.
Music belongs to all. As long as you are willing to, please be free to listen, to touch; to love, to criticise; to comment, to create. I’ll be sad the next time I hear “I don’t know music theory”, okay?
