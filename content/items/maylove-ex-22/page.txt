!<h1 “我从哪里来” —— 认识避孕>

一个科普互动小游戏，帮助观众通过动手操作来加深对于不同避孕方式的认识，在未来生活的探索中更加安全。主要负责在已有想法的基础上重新设计互动流程并实现之。

!<h1 “身体红绿灯” —— 身体接触的隐私意识>

一个互动装置，用触摸点亮“身体教科书”上身体的不同部位，观察不同的颜色，看到图上的孩子对自己身体的隐私认识。主要负责技术实现部分。

硬件是由 STM32 结合红外距离传感器做的，在学校拼好电路之后打包邮寄到深圳。后来时间紧张很焦虑，拉上外援 bw 同学来一起当了几天焊接工。途中还得到了隔壁社团同学的大量帮助和好朋友的支持，努力思考怎么报答中。
但是远程工作遇到的困难比预想中多得多，自己在这方面的经验也有限，出现了各种难以解决的问题，最后大部分的手势交互还是不太能正常工作，只好改成了常亮的彩灯。好像也白给人添了不少麻烦，挺难过的 ._.

!<h1 “The Origin of Me” —— Understanding Contraception>

An interactive exploration helping the audience gain an understanding of different contraceptive methods through a hands-on gaming experience, acquiring awareness of safety in the explorations of life in the future. Mainly worked on redesigning interactive processes based on existing ideas and the technical implementation.

After the finish of the exhibition, the game was published under the <link https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en CC BY-NC-SA 4.0> licence. It can be played <subpagelink maylove-ex-22/play here>.

!<h1 “Traffic Lights of the Body” —— Awareness of Privacy in Physical Contact>

An interactive device where parts of “the body textbook” can be lit by waving hands in front of it. The different colours of light reveal the understandings by the children regarding the privacy of their own bodies. Mainly worked on the technical implementation.

The hardware was implemented by STM32 with infrared proximity sensors, assembled in the school and mailed to Shenzhen. Later into the project I got distressed due to the tight time schedule, so I invited a friend Bw as the external assistance as a welder. Through the project was also a lot of help from the club next door as well as the support from friends. Trying hard to think of ways to repay them.
However, remote collaboration was way more challenging then expected. Due to my own lack of experience, a lot of tough problems arose and the gestural interactions did not work out in the end. The light belts were replaced with always-on ones. It was regretful to have created tremendous hassle (especially for others) without a satisfying outcome ._.
