结束了前半学期的忙碌之后，终于重新捡起了开学时的想法，把自己乱七八糟的产物集中整理起来。
这一个月着实发生了许多事情，紧张赶场的艺术团大赛排练、身边的远方的各种变故带来的替代性创伤、传染病扩散下的人心惶惶与如同流亡般的被迫离校，好像刚离开幽暗的隧道，就又被丢在高空的钢丝上孤独地摇摇晃晃，不安定的气氛充斥着每一天。
每次被问起家乡的时候，总要在好几个省份之间纠结一番，也经常开玩笑说自己四海为家；尽管我确实对物质世界不怎么上心，可是总有一部分灵魂要被注入有形之物、随着它们迷失在世界，失控混沌的现实终究承载不起自如生长的遐思。
我尚未拥有一个能滋养安心感的混凝土空间，但我是何其有幸，可以在赛博空间里一针一线般亲手织起一片天地，一个可以任性舒展、可以逃避躲藏的地方，在其中觅得几分安宁。我知道关于它的几乎一切，它也窥见过我的许多秘密；要是在这里驻足的客人能带着多一分的愉悦或是充实离去，我也会由衷地感到幸福吧。
祝看到这里的伙伴们找到独属于自己的那份安定。有空多来玩呀！

Having made my way through a hectic half of the academic term, I finally picked up where I left off months ago and put together a place for all the odds and ends produced throughout the past years.
It’s been a month filled with caprices — the hurries between rehearsals for the art troupe’s competitions, the vicarious traumas from incidents nearby and far away, the spread of panic along with the pandemic, the unavoidable choice of leaving school that almost seemed like an exile — there is an unsettling atmosphere deluging every day, as if we’ve just got out of a dark tunnel only to be thrown on a high wire, wobbling in solitude.
Whenever asked about my hometown, I always get torn between answers of several provinces and resort to joking that I am an unconstrained cosmopolitan. It is true that I am rather nonchalant regarding the material world, but there is always a part of the spirit that gets injected into tangible things and becomes lost in the world with them; the chaos of a reality out of control can never bear the rambling reveries.
I do not yet have a space of concrete to nourish the peace of mind, but am fortunate enough to be able to weave a world in cyberspace with my own hands, a place to stretch out, to escape to and hide in; a place to pick up bits of serenity. I know almost everything about it, and it has witnessed my secrets; I would be heartily delighted if guests who stop here leave with a bit more pleasure or fulfilment.
Wish all who have read this far the ability to find the peacefulness of their own. Will always be pleased to have you here!
