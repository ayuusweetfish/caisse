<link courses-21> is a collection of immature exercises in cinematic composition and song production.
<link ne-er-do-well> is a hilarious song (which is large a result of the waggish style of the lyricist).
<link gradatim> is a platformer/rhythmic game, as the final project in a course on program design. It does not have rich-enough content, hence only a video has been put up.
