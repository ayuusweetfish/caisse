作为大师 Verdi 的代表作，《茶花女》的音乐拥有无可挑剔的描写手法与结构安排。描写的细节或许不难为听众所注意，但是这部歌剧的音乐结构却是隐藏在表面之下的更加精巧的设计。在歌剧音乐中，由于舞台与台词占据了观众的注意力，音乐本身的宏观结构退居其后，在更深的层次发挥作用。优秀的构思追求在不知不觉间引导观众的情感走向，而若缺乏这样的设计，则会使音乐更像是情感碎片的简单堆叠，让表现力大打折扣。从《茶花女》的音乐中，可以看出 Verdi 在此方面进行了深思熟虑，将全剧的情感连贯而细致地传递给了演出者与听众。

音乐结构主要通过“再现”的形式体现出来，通过动机的重复或变化重复来强调感情或引导听众回忆，从而使全曲连贯、统一。在《茶花女》中，许多反复出现的动机在第一幕前的序曲中交融，这正体现了它概括剧情、渲染氛围的作用，同时也使之成为探究全剧音乐结构的入口。

!<hr>

序曲由半数小提琴在高音区缓慢奏出的 B 小调上的动机引入，这是全剧中的第一个重要主题，我们暂且称之为“病床”。

!<img image-01.png <= p. 1，“病床”主题> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

这代表主人公 Violetta 因病卧床的情景。它后来在第三幕的前奏曲与第一场 Violetta 卧床的场景中都以原样出现（移到了 C 小调），听众在那时将明确地意识到这个主题的含义。在那时，旋律所处的高音区、慢板的速度、和声小调的阴暗色彩、极弱中包含一个突强的病态般的力度以及谨慎的声部进行，无一不将 Violetta 所受病痛的折磨与虚弱的状态展现在听众眼前，让人不禁屏息，仿佛自己也在 Violetta 的房间里目睹着这一切，心生哀怜。

可是作为序曲的引子，这似乎与剧中第一幕所描绘的景象不符：后者包括宴会上一片欢愉的景象，以及关于爱情的歌颂和纠结。这与 Violetta 的病痛有什么关系呢？对此有多种不同的解释，既可以将其解释为交代“Violetta 刚从病中恢复”的前情，亦<link https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5TrVxjPIG2MJ:https://operalively.com/forums/content.php/166-Opera-In-Depth-La-Traviata-5-Musical-Analysis-opera 有人认为>是根据小仲马的小说原文，采用了倒叙的手法。将“病床”主题置于前奏曲的开头，形成了相隔两幕的前后呼应，虽然只是普通的重复，却极大程度上连贯了剧中的情感。听众在第三幕时会被带回前奏曲的开头，而前奏曲后续部分舞曲般欢快的场景也回到听众的心中，仿佛当下的苦难与回忆中的快乐形成了鲜明对比，让人不禁感慨世事无常，扼腕叹息——这一切不正是 Violetta 卧床时的所思所想吗！仅靠看似简单的前后重复就将听众吸引到主人公的内心世界，由此足以见得音乐结构在歌剧中的神奇力量。

!<hr>

序曲接着不断增加乐器并变化调性，色彩逐渐明快，直至最后通过明确的 E 大调上的属—主进行，进入一个活泼欢快的节奏上。一小节后即出现了第二个重要的主题，暂且称之为“爱情”。

!<img image-02.png <= p. 2，“爱情”主题> <= orig-size syncdark>>
!<img image-03.png <= p. 2，“爱情”主题> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

这个主题再现于第二幕第一场 Violetta 受 Alfredo 父亲要求决定离开 Alfredo 时深情而决绝地唱出“爱我，Alfredo”的场景。

!<img image-04.png <= p. 190，“爱我，Alfredo”> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

Violetta 对 Alfredo 的深情只增不减，但她不得不离开 Alfredo 而面对两人未知的未来。深爱、不舍、无奈、急切、痛苦、坚决，无数种情绪交织在一起，令人动容，也将这一主题与深情却坎坷的爱紧紧地联系在了一起。

这个主题第二次再现于第三幕 Violetta 与 Alfredo 重逢后 Violetta 累倒在地，Alfredo 唱起“让我们远离巴黎，我的挚爱”之前，由木管组以较慢的速度和十分空灵的声部配置作变化重复。

!<img image-05.png <= p. 378，木管组的主题再现> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

实际上并没有直接证据表明 Verdi 在此处的意图是再现“爱情”主题，但这样的旋律线条让人很难不把它与这个主题联系起来。此句位于两个全体休止的小节中间，在剧情中处于重逢的喜悦之后、Alfredo 真切的关怀之前，与离别时 Violetta 的真情流露形成呼应，似乎在此时回忆过往，感叹命运多舛。

“爱情”主题突出呈现两人之间深刻的爱情与无情的命运之间的强烈冲突，也是后两幕中的重要主题。不过在序曲中，这一主题以相对明快的节奏与配器呈现，令人感受到爱情的甜蜜，但纵观全剧后再回到序曲，又会从这欢快的旋律中尝到不一样的苦涩滋味，实属精妙。

一个有趣的细节是在序曲后半部分出现的“颤音后二度下行”的短小动机。这个乐汇在序曲中于“爱情”主题后出现，而在上述第二幕中“爱我，Alfredo”旋律出现之前，则将这个动机以及前面的重复跳音堆叠形成了织体，在密集的音符中把情绪推向了高潮，将 Violetta 内心翻涌却难言的苦涩描绘得淋漓尽致——“看见了吗？我正对你微笑呢！”或许这正是在描写 Violetta 的啜泣吧？

!<img image-06.png <= p. 4，序曲中出现的动机> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-07.png <= p. 188，Violetta 的啜泣> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

另外，在 Violetta 的这些台词之后（“爱我，Alfredo”呼之欲出之前），不仅可以听到中提琴和大提琴对“爱情”主题的变化先现，也可以找到序曲中“八度下行接同音反复”和“二度上下行”两个乐思的呼应。前者的这份紧张感尤为强烈，这或许寓意着甜蜜的爱情遭受的无情打击，也可以是父亲的威严或是疾病的折磨，让人为之心头一紧。而在序曲中，它经历了短暂的踌躇之后就重新回到了“爱情”主题，颇有一种摆脱苦难后的幸福感。在第三幕将现实的残酷展现无遗后重新体会此处，着实令人唏嘘。如前所述，这首序曲或许是 Violetta 卧床时对过往的回忆，那么她在临终前是不是也为了曾经的这份幸福而感慨过呢？

!<img image-08.png <= p. 189，“八度下行接同音反复”动机与“爱情”主题变化先现> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-09.png <= p. 189，“二度上下行”> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-10.png <= p. 3，序曲中的前述两个动机> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

而序曲中从“病床”到“爱情”两个主题间的过渡段也可以见到后者的变化先现以及“啜泣”动机的些许影子。

!<img image-11.png <= p. 1，中提琴演奏的“爱情”变化先现以及第一小提琴的二度下行> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

除此之外，序曲结尾处的琶音和快速二度上下行也在 Violetta 与 Alfredo 分别的瞬间出现。

!<img image-12.png <= p. 6，序曲结尾的动机> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-13.png <= p. 191，第二幕第一场结尾 Violetta 与 Alfredo 的道别> <= orig-size syncdark>>
!<img image-14.png <= p. 191，第二幕第一场结尾 Violetta 与 Alfredo 的道别> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

由此看来，“爱情”主题实际上远不止“爱我，Alfredo”的这段旋律，而是包含了上述这些乐汇的一系列反复出现的碎片。这个较大的主题组成了序曲的后半部分。

值得一提的是，在剧中有另一个代表爱情的主题，在 Alfredo 对 Violetta 求爱时出现，暂且称之为“苦乐交融”。虽然在序曲中没有出现，它也是在剧中多次再现的重要主题。

!<img image-15.png <= p. 55，Alfredo“幸福的一天”> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-16.png <= p. 84，Violetta 似乎被 Alfredo 真挚的情感所打动> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-17.png <= p. 352，Violetta 读信时的主题再现> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

与前面展开分析的这个“爱情”主题相比，“苦乐交融”主题强调的则是爱情本身的真挚与纠结，不仅 Violetta 面对求爱时的纠结，而且也有 Alfredo 在发现自己坠入爱河时的踌躇与深思——用“misterioso”形容爱情确实贴切。不过，这个主题终究是象征着幸福的，而在第三幕第四场 Violetta 读信时，它却出现在令人不安的弦乐震音上，最后在 Violetta 一声“太晚了！”的哀叹中支离破碎。“将人生有价值的东西毁灭给人看”大抵如此吧！

!<hr>

回到序曲中的两个主题。序曲的整体结构至今已经十分明晰：
!<list
  <li 从“病床”主题引入（1—7 小节）；>
  <li 渐强并转调，包括“爱我，Alfredo”旋律的先现（8—16 小节）；>
  <li “爱我，Alfredo”旋律在小提琴上出现（17—24 小节）；>
  <li 被“八度下行震音”打断并返回（25—28 小节）；>
  <li “爱我，Alfredo”旋律在大提琴上出现（29—35 小节）；>
  <li “爱我，Alfredo”旋律的变化再现与“啜泣”动机的出现（36—43 小节）；>
  <li “离别”动机以及结尾（44—49 小节）。>
>
其中几乎每个微小的乐汇都在剧中出现，用结构上的呼应巧妙地在不知不觉中把听众带进剧中人物的情感中去，而整首序曲自身又构成一个短小的故事。由此可以揣摩出许多大师创作时的思考方式与创作手法，实属高明。

在这首序曲的结尾，会不会是 Violetta 在病床上从内心向 Alfredo 道别呢？Violetta 离开 Alfredo 之后所去的地方，一定没有病痛折磨，也再无人世间的苦难了。而 Alfredo 如果知道这一切，一定也会生活得更加幸福吧。

The music of <it La Traviata>, the masterpiece of Verdi, is impeccably depicted and structured. The details of the descriptions may not be difficult for the listener to notice, but the musical structure of the opera is a more subtle design that lies beneath the surface. In operatic music, the macro-structure of the music itself takes a back seat to the deeper levels as the stage and the lines dominate the audience's attention. Excellent conception seeks to unwittingly guide the audience's emotional direction, whereas a lack of such design can make the music feel more like a simple pile of emotional fragments, making it much less expressive. In the music of <it La Traviata>, Verdi's thoughtfulness in this regard is evident in the way in which the emotions of the play are coherently and carefully conveyed to both performer and listener.

The structure of the music is mainly expressed in the form of 'recapitulation', where the repetition or variation of motifs is used to emphasise feelings or to guide the listener's recollection, thus providing coherence and unity throughout the piece. In <it La Traviata>, many of the recurring motifs intermingle in the overture before the first act, which reflects its role as a summary of the plot and atmosphere, and also makes it a gateway to an exploration of the musical structure of the play.

!<hr>

The overture is introduced by a motif in B minor played slowly in the upper register by half a dozen violins, the first major theme of the play, which we shall provisionally call 'The Sick Bed'.

!<img image-01.png <= p. 1, the "sickbed" theme> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

This represents the scene in which the main character, Violetta, is bedridden by illness. It later appears in its original form (moved to C minor) in the Prelude to Act III and in the first scene with Violetta in bed, when the listener will be clearly aware of the meaning of the theme. The high register of the melody, the tempo of the adagio, the gloomy colouring of the harmonic minor, the very weakness with a sudden, morbid intensity, and the discreet vocal progressions all bring to light Violetta's suffering and frail state, taking one's breath away as if one were witnessing it in Violetta's room and feeling pity for her.

But as an introduction to the overture, this seems at odds with the scene depicted in the first act of the play: the latter includes a joyous scene at a party, with songs and tangents about love. What does this have to do with Violetta's illness? This has been interpreted in various ways, either as a prelude to 'Violetta's recent recovery from her illness', or <link https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5TrVxjPIG2MJ:https://operalively.com/forums/content.php/166-Opera-In-Depth-La-Traviata-5-Musical-Analysis-opera by some> as a flashback to the original Dumas novel. The placement of the 'sick-bed' theme at the beginning of the prelude creates a back-and-forth between the two acts, which, although a mere repetition, is a great deal more consistent with the emotions of the play. The listener is transported back to the beginning of the Prelude in Act III, and the dance-like, joyful scenes that follow the Prelude return to the listener's mind, as if the suffering of the present were in stark contrast to the joy of the memory, making one sigh with sorrow at the impermanence of the world - and isn't that what Violetta was thinking when she was in bed? The power of musical structure in opera is evident in the seemingly simple repetition that draws the listener into the inner world of the protagonist.

!<hr>

The overture goes on to add instruments and change key, gradually brightening up in colour, until it finally moves into a lively and joyful rhythm through a clear dominant-tonic progression in E major. A bar later a second important theme emerges, tentatively called "Love".

!<img image-02.png <= p. 2, "Love" theme> <= orig-size syncdark>>
!<img image-03.png <= p. 2, "Love" theme> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

This theme is reproduced in Act 2, Scene 1, when Violetta sings "Love me, Alfredo" in a heartfelt and resolute manner at the request of Alfredo's father when he decides to leave Alfredo.

!<img image-04.png <= p. 190, "Love me, Alfredo"> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

Violetta's love for Alfredo only grows, but she has to leave him and face an unknown future for both of them. A myriad of emotions - deep love, reluctance, helplessness, urgency, pain, determination - are woven together in a moving way, and tie this theme to a deep but troubled love.

This theme is repeated for the second time in Act III, after Violetta and Alfredo have reunited, when Violetta collapses from exhaustion and Alfredo sings "Let us go away from Paris, my love", repeated by the woodwind section in a slower and very ethereal vocal configuration.

!<img image-05.png <= p. 378, reproduction of the woodwind theme> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

There is no direct evidence that Verdi's intention here was to reproduce the theme of 'love', but the melodic line makes it difficult not to associate it with this theme. The phrase is situated in the middle of two plenary rests, after the joy of reunion and before Alfredo's genuine concern in the plot, and echoes Violetta's genuine emotion at the time of parting, when she seems to be reminiscing about the past and lamenting her ill fortune.

The theme of "love" highlights the intense conflict between the two men's profound love and their unforgiving fate, and is a key theme in the last two acts. In the overture, however, this theme is presented in a relatively bright tempo and orchestration, which gives a sense of the sweetness of love, but when one returns to the overture after the entire play, one can taste a different bitterness in this upbeat melody, which is very subtle.

An interesting detail is the short 'trill followed by a second down' motif that appears in the second half of the overture. This repertoire appears after the 'love' theme in the overture and before the 'Love me, Alfredo' melody in Act II above, where this motif and the preceding repeated skipping notes are stacked to form a weave that pushes the mood to a dense note The climax of the melody is the unexplainable bitterness of Violetta's inner turmoil - "Do you see? I'm smiling at you!" Perhaps this is a depiction of Violetta's sobbing?

!<img image-06.png <= p. 4, motif from the overture> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-07.png <= p. 188, Violetta's sobs> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

In addition, after these lines by Violetta (before "Love me, Alfredo" is spoken), one can hear not only the variations on the theme of "love" preceded by the viola and cello, but also the echoes of the two musical ideas of the overture, "octave down with homophonic repetition" and "second up and down". (before the 'Alfredo' is called out). This tension is particularly strong in the former, which may suggest the relentless blow to sweet love, the majesty of a father or the torment of an illness, which can make one's heart clench. In the overture, after a brief hesitation, it returns to the theme of "love", with a sense of happiness at being free from suffering. It is saddening to revisit it after the harshness of reality has been revealed in the third act. As mentioned earlier, this overture may be a reminder of Violetta's past as she lies in bed, but did she also lament this happiness before she died?

!<img image-08.png <= p. 189, "octave down with homophonic repetition" motif and "love" theme anticipation> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-09.png <= p. 189, "upward and downward runs of seconds"> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-10.png <= p. 3, the two preceding motifs in the prologue> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

The transition between the themes of "Sickbed" and "Love" in the overture is also preceded by a change in the latter and a slight hint of the "sobbing" motif.

!<img image-11.png <= p. 1, the change to "love" in the viola is preceded by a second downward movement in the first violin> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

In addition, the arpeggios and rapid second downward movement at the end of the overture also appear at the moment of separation between Violetta and Alfredo.

!<img image-12.png <= p. 6, motif at the end of the overture> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-13.png <= p. 191, Violetta's farewell to Alfredo at the end of Act II Scene 1> <= orig-size syncdark
!<img image-14.png <= p. 191, Act II, scene 1, end Violetta's farewell to Alfredo> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

It seems that the theme of 'love' is in fact much more than just the melody of 'Love me, Alfredo', but contains a series of recurring fragments of these repertoires. This larger theme forms the second half of the overture.

It is worth noting that there is another theme of love that appears in the play when Alfredo woos Violetta, tentatively called 'Bittersweet'. Although it does not appear in the overture, it is also an important theme that recurs several times in the play.

!<img image-15.png <= p. 55, Alfredo "Happy Day"> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-16.png <= p. 84, Violetta seems moved by Alfredo's genuine emotions> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>
!<img image-17.png <= p. 352, Violetta's recreation of the theme as she reads the letter> <= orig-size caption syncdark>>

In contrast to the 'love' theme developed earlier in the analysis, the 'bittersweet' theme emphasises the sincerity and entanglement of love itself, not only in the face of Violetta's wooing, but also in Alfredo's hesitation and reflection when he finds himself in love --The term 'misterioso' is an apt description of love. However, the theme is ultimately symbolic of happiness, and in Act III, Scene IV, when Violetta reads her letter, it appears on a disturbing string vibrato, culminating in Violetta's "It's too late! The theme is ultimately a symbol of happiness, but in Act III, Scene IV, when Violetta reads the letter, it appears to fall apart in a lament. So much for "destroying what is valuable in life for others to see"!

!<hr>

Back to the two themes of the overture. The overall structure of the overture has been clear so far.
!<list
  <li Introduction from the theme of "Sickbed" (bars 1-7);>
  <li Crescendo and transposition, including the first appearance of the melody "Love me, Alfredo" (bars 8-16);>
  <li The melody "Love me, Alfredo" on the violin (bars 17-24);>
  <li Interrupted and returned by the "octave down vibrato" (bars 25-28);>
  <li The melody "Love me, Alfredo" on the cello (bars 29-35);>
  <li Recapitulation of the melodic variation of "Love me, Alfredo" and the appearance of the "sobbing" motif (bars 36-43);>
  <li "Parting" motif and coda (bars 44-49). >
>
Almost every tiny phrase in the piece is present in the play, and the structural echoes subtly draw the listener into the emotions of the characters without them realising it, while the overture itself forms a short story. It is possible to detect the way in which many of the masters thought about and composed their works, which is very clever.

The overture ends with Violetta saying goodbye to Alfredo from her sickbed, in a place where there must be no more suffering and no more human misery. Violetta leaves Alfredo, and Alfredo would have been happier if he had known this.
