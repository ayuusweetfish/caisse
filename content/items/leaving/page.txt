在学校经历了封楼之后人心惶惶，纠结再三终于还是决定给学校减轻一些压力，收拾行李准备回家。其实最不舍的可能就是排练厅了，但时间安排实在是比较混乱，甚至在群里看到大家问有没有合排才想起要是音乐会没有取消的话原本今天应该还在快乐小合排。再加上不知道哪里来的、和各种人事物混作一团的分离焦虑，所以在前一天只有赶工改首曲子的心力了。反正就是离开哪儿都要恋恋不舍好久，就是这么没出息 ; - ;
引用一句歌词，“毕竟如果看到你的眼睛的话，告别什么的就会特别、特别、特别、特别、特别……”到现在好像也还是不太敢面对这种按时完成的告别呀。
乐器是颤音琴和马林巴，理论上都可以用双槌演奏，但是自己没摸过所以也不好说hh 另外颤音琴演奏员需要吹一段口哨。预览音频是 MuseScore 直出，滚奏和倚音有点奇怪。希望可以按时回学校玩一玩呜呜呜呜。

第二天回家的时候把非常喜欢的手套弄丢了一只，于是一路上都在伤心地画画，还把手机画没电了。起了个标题叫<link adventure 《%》>，意外地和这首歌也挺贴切的。所以也就拿路上随便拍的（唯一）一张照片作封面啦。

As the atmosphere be stirred with quarantines going on in the school buildings, I finally settled down my hesitation to pack my luggage and prepare for the leave. The rehearsal hall was probably the one I was most upset about, but I was in too much of a mess to make up time for it, and it was only when I saw friends in the group asking whether there was a rehearsal that I remembered that had the concert not been cancelled, I would have been enjoying a part rehearsal today. Add to this the separation anxiety coming from nowhere mixing up with everything and everybody, and I only had enough effort to sketch out a piece of rearrangement. I always get this reluctant before leaving anywhere, so incompetant ; - ;
To quote the lyrics, “After all if I see your eyes, the farewell will be so, so, so, so, so…” I still don’t seem able to say this kind of scheduled goodbyes.
The instrumentation is a vibraphone and a marimba, both theoretically playable with double mallets though I have not tried. The vibraphone player also needs to blow whistles. The preview audio is exported from MuseScore without adjustmets, rendering the rolls and appoggiature a bit weird. Hoping to get back to school as planned and get my hands on it.

On my way home the next day I lost one of my cherished gloves and was doodling sadly all the way until the phone ran out of battery. Titled it <link adventure>, which unexpectedly fit the song’s title well; and went forward to use a photo (the only one) taken on the way as the cover.
