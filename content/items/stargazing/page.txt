我是星星——或者说是一名星空的粉刷匠；我没有名字，也不需要，但既然大家都用星星来称呼我，就这样也不错。
四下闪烁着的光芒将这份工作渲染得绮丽梦幻。身处空旷开阔的夜空，编排着星座的舞蹈，看着它们的光亮洒向地面，化作温暖、愉悦、孤独、思念，映出世间的一切，似乎没有比这更幸福的事了。

I am a star — or a painter of the stars, to be exact. I don’t have a name, nor do I need one; but since everyone treats stars as my symbol, I’ll happily accept that.
The work is wondrous, brimming with sparkling fantasies with all the glitters shining around. In the vast expanse of the night sky, orchestrating the dance of constellations, watching their lights reach the ground and turn into warmth, into joy, into loneliness, into pinings, reflecting all corners of the world — there does not seem to be anything happier and more fulfilling than this.

可是这里并不尽是棉花糖般轻飘飘的美好。作为一颗星，或者说，一个星星的制造者，自然要担起指引的职责。人们望向星星——望向我——期待着它们能指明方向、照亮道路。起初，我热切地接纳这份责任，许愿绘制出世界上最可靠的罗盘、绽放出世界上最明亮的光芒，因为我喜欢看到地上散发出的美妙气氛，喜欢看到那里的文明创造出一点一滴的生气与灵性。然而，如遥远的星星一样，我苦于自己视野的边界，无法得知大地每个角落正发生着的故事。迷茫渐渐将我包围，四下除了我所画下的一切——也就是我自己——之外，尽是无边的空虚；没有人再能陪伴我，我也无从知晓我笔下的夜空在人们眼里究竟是什么模样，无从知晓那些亮点是否还值得依赖。
直到有一天，地上洪水泛滥，生灵们却只能失去方向东奔西窜。远远望去只见一片模糊的混沌景象，让我更加难过。我终于看见，自己错得太多了。
我不敢再拿起笔刷，不敢再面对我曾工作的这片星空与远方的土地。我躲进岩石洞穴里一个劲地自我厌弃，反正世界少了谁都照样转，会有别的星空粉刷匠来值班，那我大可以尽情地哭、尽情地睡、尽情地逃避，就这样昏天黑地。我做得不好、我害了那么多的生灵、我彻底辜负了寄托在自己身上的信任、我无颜面对大地无颜面对星空无颜面对同为粉刷匠的大家……

However, this is not all about fluffly candyfloss. As a star, or rather, a maker of stars, I naturally bear the duty of guiding. People gaze upon the stars — upon me — hoping for a pointer of direction illuminating their path. I started out eagerly embracing this duty, aspiring to forge the world’s most reliable compass and cast the brightest starlight the world has ever witnessed, for I delighted in witnessing the wondrous ambiance that emanates from the land, revelling in the vitality and spirituality meticulously crafted by its civilizations. Yet, akin to a distant star, I am dejectedly limited by the boundaries of my sight, unable to fathom the myriad tales unfolding in every corner of the land. Bewilderment gradually enshrouded me, leaving in its wake the infinite emptiness except for what I have painted — which is also myself. No longer was there anyone to keep me company, nor did I have any possible idea of how the night sky I had depicted was perceived by humanity or whether those gleaming dots still warranted reliance.
Until one fateful day when a deluge ravaged the land, and beings found themselves adrift, losing their way in the pandemonium. Gazing from afar, all I could discern was a blurred and chaotic tableau, adding to my despair. I finally realized the extent of my blunder.
I no longer dared to wield the brush again or to face the expanse of stars I once laboured upon and the distant lands beyond. I retreated into the depths of a rocky cave, consumed by relentless self-reproach. The world would still continue its course with any particular person missing and there will be other fellow painters on duty, so I surely could weep, slumber, and escape, unabated until the end of time. I have done poorly, caused harm to countless lives, utterly betrayed the trust bestowed upon me, and now I should be ashamed to face the land, the starry sky, my fellow painters…

——等等，同为粉刷匠的大家？
我望向洞口照进来的微弱亮光。我被自己蒙蔽了双眼，只看得见自己值班时的工作；大家现在大概还在忙碌着吧。这么说，只因为我不自信、觉得自己犯了些错，就要把这些苦果都揽到自己身上，是不是有些过于自我中心？会不会，大家都在等着我回去？又或者他们会赶我走？
可即使被赶走也总比这样不负责任地消失要好。早点出发吧——我攥着笔刷低着头回到星空，找回自己逃开的工作。似乎并没有责备或是失望落到我头上，这让我更加煎熬；再者，我也还没能拾起重新正视那片土地的勇气。
我还是时常自责、自卑。可是千真万确，每天都有无数视线投向我画下的亮点，照着它们指明的道路踏上旅途；每天都有无数的光芒从我身边出发，去染上人间烟火的绚丽颜色。

— … Wait, other fellow painters?
I gazed towards the faint light seeping through the cave’s entrance. I had blinded myself, only able to see my own work during my shifts; everyone else must still be toiling away. Have I been excessively egocentric in shouldering all the bitterness due to my lack of confidence and my perception of the causes of mistakes? Could it be that everyone is waiting for my return? Or perhaps they will drive me away?
But even being driven away would be preferable to disappearing such irresponsibly. I’d be setting off as soon as possible — clenching the brush tightly and lowering my head, I returned to the starry sky and picked up from where I had left. Seemingly, neither blame nor disappointment was directed towards me, which only intensified my torment. And I still had not picked up the courage to confront the land which I had turned my back on.
I still frequently berated and belittled myself. However, it was undeniably true that each day, countless pairs of eyes looked upon the highlights I had painted, embarking on journeys guided by their brilliance, and countless beams of light set off from my side to immerse in the resplendent hues of humankind.

有一天我望着其他同伴。他们是别的星星，有的比我更明亮，有的比我更斑斓，在我逃避的日子里是大家默默努力填上了空白（空“黑”？），可是没有人责怪我。我猜不透，或许他们也曾走过同样的迷茫困苦？又或是我的责任与错误没有想象中那么沉重？
又有一天我终于鼓足勇气再一次看向远方的大地。我看见上面星星点点的轮廓，却无从得知那里的每一朵花如何绽放、每一滴雨如何飘落。我只能看着这依稀可见的影子，依靠着它来描摹自己身边的图画——大地，不就是我的星空吗。
我的伙伴们是星星，看着我的人们是星星。我们都是星星。
一颗星星指不了路。天空、大地，也正互相指引着。我不禁释然，摇头叹息从前的自己是那么狭隘、那么自命不凡。世界瞬息万变的一切，怎么是哪个个体能承担得起的呢。
我是星星——或者说是一名星空的粉刷匠。我未必能发光、未必能指路，但是远眺着大地——于我而言的星空——手上的笔刷便似乎更加坚定了几分。我想这就足够了。

One day, I gazed at my fellow companions. They were other stars, some brighter than me, others more vibrant. During the days of my evasion, they silently filled in the blanks, yet no one blamed me. I could not puzzle it out. Perhaps they too had traversed the same bewildering hardships? Or maybe my duties and mistakes were not as burdensome as I had imagined?
Then, on another day, I mustered the courage to look once again at the distant land. I beheld the scattered silhouettes there, but remained oblivious to how each flower bloomed or each raindrop fell there. I could only gaze at these faintly visible shadows, relying on them to sketch the tableau around me — isn’t the land “the sky” to me?
My companions are stars. Those who look at me are stars. We all are stars.
A single star cannot guide the way. The sky and the land, they mutually guide each other. I couldn’t help but feel relieved, shaking my head and sighing at how narrow-minded and pretentious I had been in the past. How could any individual bear the weight of all the ever-changing facets of the world?
I am a star — or a painter of the stars, to be exact. I may not give off light or point out the directions, but but as I gaze into the distance of the land — to me, the sky — I seem to gain a bit more determination to hold my brush firmly. And I think that is enough.

我曾经梦想成为优秀的乐手、音乐作者，梦想在空气的振动中成为值得信赖的基石；曾在基本功练习时想象着自己制造的拍点如一张大网托起管乐的美丽共振，也曾在被赋予沉重责任后认真地在新年愿望里写下“拥有配得上指挥位置的能力与自信”。我想做一颗明亮而温暖的无名星星。
可是正如本科入学时我幻想着成为一位很厉害的工程师、却被 3.01 的学分绩拖出美梦一样，站在乐队前方与四周，大大小小的失误总是提醒着我那些梦想都太过遥远，甚至如刺耳的闹铃将美梦之下深睡的我无情吵醒。我是那么渴望追逐尽善尽美的每个理想、在星空中画下更多灿烂，但我想要的太多太多，能实现的却太少太少。

I once dreamt of becoming an exceptional player and creator of music, dreamt of myself being a reliable cornerstone amidst the vibrations of the air. I imagined the beats I create during the practices turning into a vast net that holds and uplifts the gorgeous resonance of the winds. I inscribed in my New Year's wishes the desire to possess the competence and confidence befitting the role of a conductor after being entitled as such. I aspired to be a nameless star, bright and heartwarming.
Yet, just as my fantasies of becoming an outstanding engineer in undergraduate years were shattered by a GPA of 3.01, standing before the band and surrounded by my peers, the multitude of mistakes, big and small, keep reminding me that those dreams are too distant. Sometimes, they are like a noisy alarm clock that pulls me up from beneath the layers of floating sweet reveries. I yearn so much to chase every perfect ideal, to spread more brightness onto the night sky, but there are so much that I desire and so little that I can realize.

其实我大概不过是个自命不凡的笨蛋而已。不过那又如何呢。能与更多的星星一同前行，我想这就足够了。
在这里被容纳、从这里发出自己的光，就是一场永远会让我感到幸福的美梦。从两年前默念着“Dreams come true”演出的《Zzz》、第一次来到一队专场时沉浸的七夕之夜，直到今年的二队星星贺卡还有专场上的《I Dreamed a Dream》，都足以掩盖各自背后的甘苦，在回忆的夜空闪闪发光。我也许愿成为这美梦里的一个星点，悄悄地陪伴许多与我一起神往过巴比伦河畔、遐想过拉普达传说、描绘过春日的盛放的，今年就要毕业的九字班二队。
孤单的时候就抬头看看吧。无论在哪里、无论能不能看得见星星，至少地上的生灵仰望的永远会是同一片天空。

Maybe I am nothing more than a conceited fool. But does that matter? To journey alongside more stars, I think that is enough.
Being embraced here and allowed to give off my own light, is a euphonious dream that will bring me happiness forever. From <link zzz “Zzz”>, which I performed silently reading “Dreams come true”, the Tanabata night that I soaked myself into on my first stage experience after graduating as an apprentice, until the star-decorated postcard on this year's apprentices' concert and “I Dreamed a Dream” on the band concert, each is enough to overshadow the sweetness and bitterness behind it, shining in the night sky of memories. I wish to become a star among them, quietly accompanying those many that have fantasized about the banks of Babylon, delved into the tales of Laputa, and illustrated the joy of spring — those who went through apprenticeship with me but will be graduating this year.
In times of solitude, look up. Wherever you may be, no matter whether the stars are visible, all creatures of the land will always gaze upon the same sky.
