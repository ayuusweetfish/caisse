一个平台跳跃/节奏类游戏。只有按照音乐节拍才能找到跳跃和冲刺的时机，因此也带有不少解谜元素。

是《程序设计基础》课程的结课项目，受《啪嗒砰》和《蔚蓝》两个游戏的启发做了一个缝合品类的游戏。因为很喜欢所以那段时间一直都在做，其他课都没怎么认真学；还认真构思了一个部落遭遇天灾破坏了所有艺术所以有一位充满热情的学徒跑去周游世界求师学艺的中二故事（翻了翻当时的东西，三室一厅在抠了 (/- )

  大作业不是 Game Jam —— 一个半月的时间，久到让人可以与一堆混乱不堪的代码、图片、声音和配置文件产生感情。

由于实际游戏内容过于单薄，难度曲线也非常怪，所以只在这里放一段视频，也算不上什么完整作品啦。

标题是受拉丁短语 <lang lat gradus ad Parnassum>（登上帕那索斯山的台阶）启发。在古希腊神话中，帕那索斯山脉的两座高峰之一是太阳神阿波罗和文艺女神缪斯们的家乡，另一座则是酒神狄俄尼索斯的；因此这个短语多次被用于艺术领域的教材名字，象征通往更高水平的台阶。游戏标题 <lang lat gradatim> 在拉丁语中的含义是“一步步、逐渐”。

A platformer/rhythmic game. The moments available for jumps and dashes are dictated by rhythms of the music, adding a few puzzles to it.

The final project of the course “Fundamentals of Programming”. A hybrid-genre game inspired by Patapon and Celeste. I was quite absorbed, spending all the time on it without sparing efforts for other courses. I even had a serious idea of a story about a catastrophe-stricken tribe which lost all their arts and a passionate apprentice who went off travelling the world learning from maestri.

  The course project is not a game jam — one and a half months is enough for one to become associated with a messy pile of code, images, sounds, and configuration files.

Only a video was put up, since the content of the game was not rich enough and the difficulty curve was odd. It was not a polished project anyway.

The title was inspired by the Latin phrase <lang lat gradus ad Parnassum> (steps to Parnassus). In ancient Greek mythology, one of the two peaks of the Parnassus Mountains was home to Apollo, the god of the sun, and the Muses, the goddesses of arts; while the other to Dionysus, the god of wines. The phrase has therefore been used multiple times as titles of textbooks in arts, symbolising the stepping stones to higher levels. The game’s title <lang lat gradatim> means “step by step, gradually” in Latin.
