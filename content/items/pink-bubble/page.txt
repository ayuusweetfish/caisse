一件互动艺术装置，呈现网络暴力受害者依靠个人力量所面对的巨大困难。

!<hr>

面对网络暴力，自救与社会支持都显得无力。
事件的发展总是如此相似——我们目睹可怖的网络暴力，为惨无人道的加害者愤怒、为受害者同情，然后我们将一切埋在无尽的数据海洋中忘却。我们将这苍白的过程重复着一遍又一遍，最后事态却毫无转机。普通网民，尤其是女性，在网络空间中仍然十分危险。
你或许就是下一个受害者。我们都可能是。
你或许会想，自己是坚定的乐观主义者，有充足的社会支持，自己会坚强地反击；自己会把抑郁的黑犬吓走。
可是这真的很困难。最近的一位受害者，郑灵华（鸡蛋姬），从来积极乐观地面对生活，也在网暴事件发生后接受诊疗，还得到了家人、朋友和网友的关心，却仍然深陷抑郁的泥潭直至放弃生命。这几乎是恢复期间的最好条件，却还是没能帮她渡过难关。
——而这一切只是源于一张普普通通的照片，照片中粉色头发的她只是在病床前和爷爷分享收到录取通知书的喜悦。
我们痛心于这一眼望不到头的灰暗混沌景象。我们设计了这个互动装置，旨在引导人们关注到网络暴力下个体力量的困顿无力，呼吁管理者和政府采取监管手段来消灭伤害。

装置布置于大约 15 米 × 5 米的室内空间。

装置包含一条走廊，走廊的墙壁上投影着一段动画视频；走廊的尽头是一个玻璃围成的封闭空间，其中摆放着一位女孩的雕塑，四周的墙壁上冒出许多尖刺，而女孩周围是一层半透明的保护罩——粉色气泡。保护罩和尖刺都可以移动，由一个微型计算机控制。

我们精心调整了建筑的设计，使游客可以从装置外直接窥视到尽头的粉红色气泡。

An interactive art installation discussing the massive difficulties of individuals overcoming cyberviolence.

!<hr>

Self-help and social support is powerless when faced with cyberviolence.
It’s almost always the same — we see a frightening instance of cyberviolence, we get angry at those inhumane perpetrators, we mourn for the victim, and then we forget, burying all of it inside the endless sea of data. Whenever it happens, we do the same again and again, and finally — nothing changes. Ordinary netizens, especially women and girls, remain profoundly vulnerable in cyberspace.
You may be the next victim. We all may.
You may think that you, as a determined optimist with adequete social support, will stay strong and fight back. You may think you will scare the black dog away.
This is, sadly, hard. A recent victim, Zheng Linghua, suffered from intense depression and committed suicide despite having faced life with optimism, undergone proper medical treatment, and received care from family, friends, and online supporters. All those, being almost the best of what you can have for recovery, had not been successful in helping her overcome the pain.
— And all this started with a single innocent photo of her, with pink hair, sharing her joy with her grandfather by the sickbed after receiving an admission.
Heartbroken at the seemingly unstoppable havoc, we designed this interactive installation to raise awareness to the situation that individuals face immense difficulties and are almost impotent under cyberviolence, calling for regulatory actions by moderators and governments to stop the harm.

!<h1 Design Details #Design>

The installation is implemented in an indoor space of around 15m × 5m.

!<img floor-plan.jpg <= 3D floor plan of the installation.> square>
!<img model.jpg <= A 1:50 physical model of the installation.>>

The installation consists of a corridor, in which an animated video is projected onto the wall, and a glass-enclosed space in which a sculpture of a girl sits among spikes coming out from the walls, covered in a translucent shield — the pink bubble — around her. The shield and the spikes in this last part are both movable, controlled by a microcomputer.

!<img rendering.jpg <= Computer-rendered scenes of the space and visitors inside.>>

We carefully adjusted the architectural design so that visitors will be able to have a peek at the pink bubble at the very end directly from the outside.
!<img floor-plan-analysis.jpg <= Illustrated analyses of the floor plan, including space design considerations and illustrations of the visitors’ routes.> square>

Upon entry, the audience is first introduced to the background story through the animation. The animation depicts a girl in an open space walking into a dimmed mist, blending into the colour of the corridor itself. Through the corridor, spikes are placed on the walls, getting denser further into the space.
At the end of the corridor, the audience is introduced to the sculpture of the girl, as well as a QR code projected onto a wall beside her. As the viewer scans the code with their smartphone, the interactive part activates, with the shield inflating, protecting the girl from the spikes. Each time a new viewer joins, the shield inflates a bit more, with a light spot projected onto it with a colour corresponding to the one shown on the user’s screen. However, the shield keeps collapsing so that it eventually breaks regardless of the number of participants. The device then resets, waiting for the next batch of visitors.
We intend that the light spots stand for the social support from individuals around the victim, and through the inevitable breakdown, intend to reveal the reality that such support alone is often not enough for a victim to get over the harm.

!<h1 Interactive Prototype and Onsite Feedback #Onsite>
We implemented an interactive prototype through 2D computer animations and proper networking techniques (WebSocket), and were greeted with overall positive feedback at an onsite presentation.
!<img onsite.jpg <= A smartphone with a circular-shaped light spot; in the background is a large screen with an illustration of a girl surrounded by a bubble-shaped shield and spikes.>>
A major setback was that the meaning of the light spots was not made clear. Some participants expressed confusion towards the circle shape on their screen, stating that it was not apparent what these actually stood for.

The audience’s affirmative response to our design confirms that there is still space for public discussion around the issue of cyberviolence, as it is still a major source of potential harm for ordinary netizens, and there are aspects of it (e.g. insufficiency of social support alone) that have not received the awareness they deserve.

!<h1 Discussion and Future Work #Discussion>
Through our design and demonstration process, we have confirmed the feasibility of implementing our design in an indoor exhibition. We have selected proper materials for the construction of the space as well as for all the decorative and interactive parts, and have demonstrated a set of working combination of logical rules and network technologies through our prototype.
However, it is worth noting that the audience participating in our demonstration mainly consisted of university students and professors, who, albeit with varied backgrounds, may have similar viewpoints and understandings on certain social topics. We have not confirmed the appeal and the effect of the exhibition to a wider audience.
We are still considering the possibilities for improvements to our design. We are concerned that viewers may not proceed due to a lack of motivation; hence, we are considering a redesign of the space to prevent the viewers from observing the ending in advance; alternatively, a double-route design allowing the viewers to attend the exhibition either from the interactions inside or spectate from the outside will provide the “unmotivated” viewer with another way to engage in the exhibition.

To conclude this article, we would like to call on all of our audience to attend to the fact that cyberviolence needs further intervention from entities with regulatory power, such as platform owners, moderators, governments, etc., and this should be continue to be pushed forward. And, despite this sorrowful fact that we as ordinary netizens might not be able to do much, by all means care for the victims you know. Your care will surely be a great comfort to those who are in need during the time before the ill-intentioned perpetrators get punished and the harmful atmosphere gradually dissipates. We all look forward to that day.

!<h1 Try It #Try>
To have a taste of the experience, open <link https://pink.ayu.land/kiosk/ the demonstration page> on the computer, and scan the code there with a smartphone. Ideally, invite friends around so that each of you may contribute your own light spot on the shield. Alternatively, open <link https://pink.ayu.land/ the participants’ page> in another browser window; you may open many instances of this page and see more light spots projected onto the shield.
