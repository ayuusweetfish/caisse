!<h1 内容概要 #Overview>
从媒介（即信息载体）的普遍特性入手，分析电视如何对 20 世纪美国文化造成深刻的负面影响。随着互联网及多媒体技术的成熟，“电视文化”得到延展，其中的人们应该如何把握“娱乐”的边界，如何使媒体科技发挥积极的社会价值？书中的论述将有一定的借鉴意义。

!<h1 第一部分 #Part-1>
!<h2 Ch 1 媒介即隐喻 #Ch-1>
作者指出，自身所处的环境——20 世纪下半叶的美国——已经被浸润在表演术与娱乐活动当中了，而这一切都是名为“电视”的媒介带来的。
（注：媒介是指承载信息的任何物质，例如口语、印刷文字、电视。）
麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）认为“媒介即信息”，这是说决定文化内涵的是一个文化中主导的媒介本身，而非其承载的内容。例如，图画使得人们失去膜拜抽象的神的能力；钟表使人们的活动脱离自然昼夜更替的指导。作者说媒介即“隐喻”，是指媒介给人提供思维框架，塑造人们思考任何事物的基本方式。

!<h2 Ch 2 媒介即认识论 #Ch-2>
作者希望证明，“真理的定义至少有⼀部分来自传递信息的媒体的性质”。这即是说，用于承载信息的媒介本身的性质，会影响人们对真理的表达与判断，即认识论。
作者引用文学评论家诺思洛普·弗莱（Northrop Frye）提出的“共鸣（resonance）”的概念，指出“任何一种媒介都有共鸣，因为共鸣就是扩大的隐喻（metaphor）”。简单而言，共鸣可以理解为“媒介所触及的语境/环境下的共识”。为此作者举例：在学术环境中，人们认为出版著作或学术文章上的信息更可信，而对自己见闻的叙述则不应该作为论据，无论两者本身真实的可信度。这即是“学术写作”这一媒介所包含的共识，即所谓“共鸣”。
作者得出结论：“对于真理的认识是同表达方式密切相连的。真理不能，也从来没有毫无修饰地存在。[…] ‘真理’是一种文化偏见。”
电视媒介（注：从当下视角来看，亦包括网络社媒与短视频等注重感官体验的媒介）正在逐渐替代印刷媒介来影响人们的认识论。
针对可能的争议，作者作如下总结：
!<list
  <li 1. 本书关注媒介对话语结构（而非思维本身）的改变；>
  <li 2. 虽然铅字仍存在，但其对人们认识论的影响已大不如前，电视已成为主导；>
  <li 3. 电视的认识论污染的是理性交流，但在情感支持等方面有不可忽视的正面作用。>
>
综上，作者探讨电视媒介对“公众话语的严肃性”的实在威胁，但并不希望全盘否决之。

!<h2 Ch 3 印刷机统治下的美国 #Ch-3>
铅字的线性思维影响语言，这一点在美国尤为明显，因其早期建设者多为知识分子。美国人的公众话语常常有着论文的逻辑。
作者提出，“形式决定内容的实质”。这与麦克卢汉的“媒介即信息”观点基本一致。作为一个例子，马克思（Karl Marx）在《德意志意识形态》中提及，印刷机毁灭了伊利亚特史诗存在的条件，消灭了由吟唱与传说承载的思维模式（话语结构）。作者总结，“印刷机不仅是一种机器，更是话语的一种结构，它排除或选择某些类型的内容，然后不可避免地选择某一类型的受众。”

!<h2 Ch 4 印刷机统治下的思想 #Ch-4>
作者以 19 世纪的美国举例，那里的人们可以聆听并理解长达数小时的公共演讲或辩论，而这些口述语言也都遵循书面语言的复杂精密的行文逻辑。报纸广告也都是客观的描述性文本。当下的人们可能难以想象，但这确是事实。
印刷文字的特性是意义丰富、内容严肃，因为写下的每段文字都经过斟酌，具有含义，且读者进行阅读时也只能依据自身的知识储备与理解能力来获取信息、甚至去伪存真，即需要与文本保持距离，避免情绪化。
在 18—19 世纪的美国，大部分人都学习阅读并且加入文化对话，并不过分关心“娱乐”，创造了一个“阐释年代”。这充分展示了一种主导媒介对文化、思想的影响力。

!<h2 Ch 5 躲躲猫的世界 #Ch-5>
躲躲猫（Peek-a-Boo）是指一种面孔一隐一现以逗小孩儿的游戏。作者以此比喻信息爆炸时期人们沉迷于转瞬即逝的碎片信息所带来的低价值愉悦中。
其背后的原因是电报的出现使得承载信息的能力远大于必要的信息量，这使得“新闻”充斥着碎片化的细节信息，使得“信息-行动比”下降，即人们对于所知晓的事并不具有太大影响力，即使自身提出意见、作出行动，也只不过是被淹没在浩瀚的信息和数据中而已。电报还与照片结合，为碎片信息创造了虚假的“语境”感。在碎片信息的泛滥下，人们还创造出新的消遣形式，例如纵横字谜和欢乐问答，以消耗碎片信息。
作者指出，躲躲猫游戏本身没有问题，但是电视将整个交流环境都变成了它。“我们每个人都会筑起自己的空中楼阁，但如果我们想要住在里面，问题就出现了。”

!<h1 第二部分 #Part-2>
!<h2 Ch 6 娱乐业时代 #Ch-6>
作者首先反驳麦克卢汉的“后视镜思维”：新媒介时常推翻旧媒介，而非延展之。
每种技术都是等待被揭示的隐喻，具有自身用途的倾向，暗示着它将被如何使用、用来做何事。技术只是机器，而媒介是其创造的社会与文化环境。
在电视媒介创造的环境中，一切话语都变得娱乐化，将辩论变成提供感性愉悦的娱乐节目，其中每个人都在扮演角色而非理性思考。对于布道、手术、法律等严肃活动，电视都将其变成娱乐。这逐渐渗入到生活的其他方面，如空中安全（空乘人员带乘客玩游戏而忽略安全提示）与课堂（通过抓眼的形式与作秀来吸引学生）。每个人都在设法吸引注意力，制造视觉愉悦和往往无意义的新鲜感。作者所处的当代美国文化已经开始用娱乐的方式处理一切事务了。

!<h2 Ch 7 “好……现在”（<lang en “Now… This”>） #Ch-7>
作者认为标题的这句话是电视时代最可怕的语言，因其可以连接任意两个毫不相干的事物，标志着话语的极度碎片化。
人们希望书和电影保持内容、语气、情绪上的连贯，却早已习惯支离破碎的电视语言。碎片化的话语造成如下后果：
!<list
  <li 1. 如 Ch 6 所言，新闻失去严肃意义而被娱乐化，追求画面与播音员的视觉感官刺激；>
  <li 2. 事实的严肃性被彻底消解，播音员永远会说“下次再会”（作者指出，一些令人痛苦的新闻为什么要强调让人下次再来呢？），也永远有若无其事的广告，仿佛新闻中的一切都与自己无关，不必当真；>
  <li 3. 在观众中创造虚假的对消息的掌控感，使得所谓“民意测验”实质上成为了摇摆不定的情绪集合；>
  <li 4. 话语的上下文被剥夺，人们无暇分辨话语的一致性或真实性，难以综合信息进行有效分析。>
>

!<h2 Ch 8 走向伯利恒 #Ch-8>
伯利恒（Bethlehem）是耶稣的出生地。本章结合案例，从种种角度论述电视如何将宗教变成创造感官刺激的娱乐活动。

!<h2 Ch 9 伸出你的手投上一票 #Ch-9>
本章讲述电视政治的娱乐化。
!<blockquote “过去是一个世界，而不是一片灰色的混沌。” […] 一本书就是历史，它的一切都把我们带回到过去的时间里 […] 但是，电视 […] 是以现时为中心的。>
!<blockquote 在娱乐业和形象政治的时代里，政治话语不仅舍弃了思想，而且还舍弃了历史。[…] 我们这个时代的特征是“拒绝记忆”。[…] 在一个本身结构就是偏向图像和片断的媒介里，我们注定要丧失历史视角。>
作者指出，奥威尔（George Orwell）的预言（独裁、严格的舆论管控）之所以错误是因为其认为印刷文字会持续作为主导媒介。但是赫胥黎（Aldous Huxley）则有预见性地提出，若人们娱乐至死，则根本不必有印刷的存在，也不必有所谓“封禁”了。

!<h2 Ch 10 教学是一种娱乐活动 #Ch-10>
（注：原标题为 Teaching as an Amusing Activity，似乎更接近“娱乐式教学”的含义。）
本章讲述以《芝麻街》为首的教育节目对学习的影响。
!<blockquote “也许人们对于教育最大的错误认识是，一个人学会的只有他当时正在学习的东西。其实，伴随学习的过程形成持久的态度……也许比拼写课或地理历史课更为重要” […] 换句话说，一个人学到的最重要的东西是学习方法。>
而作者指出，电视使人们的学习方式也变得娱乐化了。可是，没有任何教育理论认为学习必须是娱乐化的；相反，它们一致认同学习是一件困难的事。
电视教育节目有三条戒律：无先修、无困惑、无阐释。可是这样一来，所谓“教育”就只剩下了娱乐。
Ch 7 曾提到过，电视剥夺了话语的上下文，因而不具推论性，不适合用于阐释意义，这与铅字截然不同。
本章最后对介绍鲸鱼的科普节目《咪咪见闻录》大加批判，指出其只是提供了大量不仅普适性低而且可从其他途径高效获得的碎片信息，却向观众潜移默化地灌输着“学习是一种娱乐”的观点。

!<h2 Ch 11 赫胥黎的警告 #Ch-11>
在 20 世纪下半叶的美国，电视已经深入到文化中，赫胥黎的“美丽新世界”预言似乎正成为现实。
没有技术是中立的，它们必然要带来社会变迁。电视已经在这时的美国掀起了文化的革命，人们已踏上了不归路。电视对文化的最大威胁就是对严肃话语的消解。不过作者又言，“如果某种媒介的使用者已经了解了它的危险性，那么这种媒介就不会过于危险。”人们最终还是需要回归学校和书本，通过理性的思考去探索破除娱乐诅咒的方法，这样方能与电视和平相处。
“人们感到痛苦的不是他们用笑声代替了思考，而是他们不知道自己为什么笑、为什么不再思考。”

!<h1 Summary of Content>
An analysis of how television has had a profoundly negative impact on 20th century American culture, starting with the universal nature of the medium (i.e. the vehicle of information). As the Internet and multimedia technologies have matured and "television culture" has expanded, how should people in it navigate the boundaries of "entertainment" and how can media technology be used for positive social value? The book's discussion will be of some interest.


!<h1 Part I #Part-1>
!<h2 Ch 1 The Medium Is the Metaphor #Ch-1>
The author points out that his own environment — the United States in the second half of the 20th century — was already steeped in performance and entertainment, and that this was all brought about by the medium known as 'television'. The medium.
(Note: A medium is any material that carries a message, such as the spoken word, the printed word, television.)
Marshall McLuhan argues that 'the medium is the message', which means that it is the dominant medium in a culture that determines its content, rather than the content it carries. For example, pictures deprive people of the ability to worship abstract gods; clocks and watches take people's activities away from the natural guidance of day and night. When the author says that the medium is a 'metaphor', he means that it provides the framework for thinking and shapes the basic way in which people think about anything.

!<h2 Ch 2 Media as Epistemology #Ch-2>
The authors wish to demonstrate that "the definition of truth derives at least in part from the nature of the medium that conveys the message". This means that the nature of the medium itself, which is used to carry the message, influences the expression and judgement of truth, i.e. epistemology.
The author cites the notion of 'resonance' by literary critic Northrop Frye, who states that 'any medium has resonance, for resonance is an expanded metaphor ". In simple terms, resonance can be understood as "consensus in the context/environment that the medium touches". To this end, the author gives the example of an academic context where information in published works or scholarly articles is considered more credible, while accounts of what one has seen should not be used as an argument, regardless of the true credibility of either. This is the consensus contained in the medium of 'academic writing', the so-called 'resonance'.
The author concludes that "the knowledge of truth is closely linked to the way it is expressed. Truth cannot, and never has, existed without embellishment. [...] 'Truth' is a cultural prejudice."
The medium of television (note: from a contemporary perspective, this also includes media that focus on sensory experiences such as online social media and short videos) is gradually replacing the medium of print to influence people's epistemology.
In response to the possible controversies, the author concludes as follows.
!<list
  <li 1. the book is concerned with the changes in the structure of discourse (rather than in thinking itself) brought about by the media; >
  <li 2. although lead still exists, its influence on people's epistemology is much less than it used to be, and television has become dominant; >
  <li 3. the epistemological pollution of television is rational communication, but has a positive effect in terms of emotional support etc. that cannot be ignored. >
>
In summary, the author examines the real threat that the medium poses to the "seriousness of public discourse", but does not wish to reject it in its entirety.

!<h2 Ch 3 Typographic America #Ch-3>
The linear thinking of the printed word influenced language, and this was particularly evident in the United States, whose early builders were mostly intellectuals. American public discourse often has the logic of a thesis.
The author suggests that 'form determines the substance of content'. This is largely in line with McLuhan's view that 'the medium is the message'. As an example, Karl Marx mentions in The German Ideology that the printing press destroyed the conditions for the existence of the Iliad's epic, eliminating the modes of thought (discursive structures) carried by chant and legend. The author concludes that "the printing press is not only a machine, but a structure of discourse that excludes or selects certain types of content and then inevitably a certain type of audience."

!<h2 Ch 4 The Typographic Mind #Ch-4>
The author gives the example of 19th century America, where people could listen to and understand hours-long public speeches or debates, and where the spoken word followed the complex and sophisticated line logic of written language. Newspaper advertisements were also objective, descriptive texts. It may be difficult for people today to imagine this, but it is true.
The printed word is rich in meaning and serious in content, because each paragraph is written with care and meaning, and the reader can only read it according to his or her own knowledge and understanding, even to the point of distancing himself or herself from the text and avoiding emotion.
In 18th and 19th century America, the majority of people learned to read and joined in cultural conversations without being overly concerned with 'entertainment', creating an 'age of interpretation'. This demonstrates the influence of a dominant medium on culture and thought.

!<h2 Ch 5 The Peek-a-Boo World #Ch-5>
Peek-a-Boo is a game in which faces appear and disappear to amuse children. The author uses it as a metaphor for the low-value pleasures of the instantaneous fragmentation of information in a time of information explosion.
The reason behind this is that the advent of the telegraph has made it possible to carry far more information than is necessary, making the 'news' full of fragmented details and reducing the 'information-action ratio', i.e. people do not have much influence over what they know Even if they do offer opinions and take action, they are simply drowned in the vastness of information and data. The telegraph has also combined with photographs to create a false sense of 'context' for fragmented information. The proliferation of fragmented information has also led to the creation of new forms of diversion, such as crossword puzzles and fun quizzes, to consume fragmented information.
The author points out that there is nothing wrong with the game of hide and seek per se, but television has turned the entire communicative environment into it. "Each of us builds our own skybox, but if we want to live in it, the problem arises."

!<h1 Part II #Part-2>
!<h2 Ch 6 The Age of Show Business #Ch-6>
The author begins by refuting McLuhan's "rear-view mirror thinking": new media often overturn old ones, rather than extend them.
Each technology is a metaphor waiting to be revealed, with its own propensity for use, suggesting how it will be used and what it will do. Technology is only a machine, and the medium is the social and cultural environment it creates.
In the environment created by the medium of television, all discourse becomes entertaining, turning debate into entertainment that provides sensual pleasure, in which everyone plays a role rather than thinking rationally. For serious activities such as sermons, surgery and law, television has turned them into entertainment. This gradually creeps into other aspects of life, such as air safety (where flight attendants take passengers through games while ignoring safety tips) and the classroom (where students are attracted by eye-catching formats and showmanship). Everyone is trying to attract attention, to create visual pleasure and often meaningless novelty. The contemporary American culture in which the author lives has begun to approach everything in an entertaining way.

!<h2 Ch 7 “Now… This” #Ch-7>
The author considers the phrase of the title to be the most frightening language of the television age, as it can connect any two unrelated things and marks the extreme fragmentation of discourse.
People want books and films to remain coherent in content, tone and mood, but have long become accustomed to the fragmented language of television. The consequences of fragmented discourse are as follows.
!<list
  <li 1. the loss of seriousness in the news and its entertainment, as Ch 6 suggests, in the pursuit of visual sensory stimulation by images and announcers;>
  <li 2. the seriousness of the facts is completely dissipated, with the announcer forever saying "see you next time" (the author points out that why should some distressing news emphasise the need for people to come back next time?) There will always be the adage that nothing is happening, as if everything in the news is irrelevant and not to be taken seriously;>
  <li 3. the creation of a false sense of control over the news among viewers, making the so-called "polls" essentially a collection of wavering emotions;>
  <li 4. depriving the discourse of its context, so that people have no time to distinguish between the coherence or truth of the words, making it difficult to synthesise information for effective analysis.>
>

!<h2 Ch 8 Shuffle Off to Bethlehem #Ch-8>
Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus. This chapter combines case studies with various perspectives on how television can turn religion into entertainment that creates sensory stimulation.

!<h2 Ch 9 Reach Out and Elect Someone #Ch-9>
This chapter is about the entertainment of television politics.
!<blockquote "The past is a world, not a grey chaos." [...] A book is history, everything about it takes us back in time [...] But television [...] is centred on the present. >
!<blockquote In the age of the entertainment industry and image politics, political discourse has shed not only ideas, but also history. [...] Our time is characterised by a "refusal of memory". [...] In a medium whose very structure is biased towards images and fragments, we are doomed to lose our historical perspective. >
The author points out that George Orwell's predictions (dictatorship, strict control of public opinion) were wrong because he believed that the printed word would continue to be the dominant medium. But Aldous Huxley was prescient in suggesting that if people were entertained to death, there would be no need for print at all, no need for a so-called 'ban'.

!<h2 Ch 10 Teaching as an Amusing Activity #Ch-10>
This chapter is about the impact of educational programmes, led by Sesame Street, on learning.
!<blockquote "Perhaps the biggest misconception about education is that all one learns is what one is learning at the time. In fact, the process of forming lasting attitudes that accompany learning ...... is perhaps more important than spelling lessons or geography and history lessons" [...] In other words, the most important thing a person learns is how to learn. >
And the author points out that television has made the way people learn entertaining as well. However, no educational theories suggest that learning has to be entertaining; on the contrary, they agree that learning is a difficult thing to do.
There are three commandments in television education: no pre-requisite, no confusion, no explanation. But in this way, what is called 'education' is nothing but entertainment.
As mentioned in Ch 7, television deprives discourse of its context and is therefore not inferential and unsuitable for interpreting meaning, unlike lead.
The chapter concludes with a critique of the popular science programme Mimi's Tales, which introduces whales and provides a lot of fragmentary information that is not only less universal but also efficiently available in other ways, while subliminally instilling the view that 'learning is entertainment'.

!<h2 Ch 11 The Huxleyan Warning #Ch-11>
In the United States in the second half of the 20th century, television had become so embedded in the culture that Huxley's prophecy of a 'beautiful new world' seemed to be coming true.
No technology was neutral, and they were bound to bring about social change. Television was already revolutionising culture in America at this time, and people were on the road to nowhere. Its greatest threat to culture was the dismantling of serious discourse. The author adds, however, that "a medium is not too dangerous if its users have understood its dangers." Ultimately, people need to go back to school and books and find ways to break the curse of entertainment through rational thought, so that they can make peace with television.
"What people feel pained about is not that they are replacing thinking with laughter, but that they don't know why they are laughing or why they are no longer thinking."
