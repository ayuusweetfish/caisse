<hr windy>

Two decades’ time with one year more
That’s how long an angel has been around for
Arriving at dawn with the sky getting bright
Look at this land like never before

<hr cloudy>

Spread the wings of feather and snow
Oh, how would this miracle ever not glow?
Fly about the sky, filled with delight
Play the birds’ song and let melodies flow

<hr cloudy>

Nothing goes on forever,
but the angel dances and lights up today
Share the moments of merriment
in the time for them to stay

<hr cloudy>

To never, never, never, never, never being afraid
For there always, always, always, always will be the angel wings

<hr cloudy>

In sun and rain, through wind and mist
Landscapes the angel had witnessed or missed
With celestial memories from up so high
But the feathers of glow could no longer persist

<hr cloudy>

On walks of day, in dreams of night
The angel cried over the broken wings
Sunk in sorrow, longing to fly
The angel sang as much as one could sing
…

<hr cloudy>

Stalk a bird, fly a kite
Roam in the sunshine along a strand
Join the campfire and be the guide
The angel’s dance goes on hand in hand

<hr cloudy>

Maybe never, never, never, never back are the broken wings
But there’s so much, so much, so much, so much to see on this wonderland
Maybe never, never, never, never back are the broken wings
But there’s so much, so much, so much, so much to see on this wonderland

<hr windy>
