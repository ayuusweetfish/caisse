2022 年初的时候 <link https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/ Josh Wardle> 设计的单词猜谜小游戏《Wordle》爆火，受此启发在军乐队寒训的时候分析了旋律猜谜的可行性，也进行了内测，最后在寒训结束后当天上线了这个小游戏。
!<h1 动机>
设计的愿景是希望每个人，无论经验如何，都可以在猜谜游戏中近距离地探索、体验、创造音乐。
一直坚定地拒绝音乐艺术中的精英主义，觉得不应该给人类耳濡目染的天生语言设置门槛。每当看到身边的同学摆摆手说“哎呀我没学过乐理见笑了”，就有些焦急得不知所措——哪有学过这些才能说话的道理呀！因此在很大程度上，Medle 就是对打破这种迷思的一次坚决的尝试。
除了科普意义之外，猜谜的过程本身正如音乐的创作与演绎一样，是一个在无数可能性中试错的过程；不同声音之间的化学反应会给人怎样的听觉和情感体验呢？我希望解谜游戏可以带领更多玩家用自己的方式探索这个问题；带他们来到这个缤纷世界，邀请他们在这里尽情玩耍。这可能是这个游戏最重视的一点吧！
!<h1 一些废话>
刚出来的时候发在了<link https://closed.social/ 闭社>，收到了超多善意，也有了许多投稿；而且真的看到了原本因“自己不懂音乐”而不太敢接触的伙伴在玩了几天之后觉得渐渐学到了一些，超级超级开心！！后来还在同学的朋友圈里小火了一把，也有身边伙伴的真诚吹捧，甚至看到了几个不同主题分支！能得到大家喜欢真好呜呜。
虽然每天都需要积攒一些工作确实挺麻烦的，但是每次收到大家的投稿都非常感动，而且拥有一个沉浸在音乐里的理由还是一件很快乐的事情！认真想过多拉些uu来合作运营，不过因为拖延就一直没细想。暑假的时候做了一个简单的在线留言板用来收投稿，但是因为界面设计的完美主义一直没有上线，现在的投稿途径仍然很混乱……
运营事故当然也少不了，比如没来得及加上题（已经是死线战神了（bu）），比如服务器被墙什么的。现在 Medle 住在分布于世界各地的云上，应该算是不那么摇摇欲坠啦！
会继续努力和大家一起玩呀！<kao ♡(*´∀｀*)人(*´∀｀*)♡>

<link https://medle.ayu.land/ Link to the game>!
Inspired by <link https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/ Josh Wardle>’s word-guessing game “Wordle”, which became a hit at the beginning of 2022, I analysed the feasibility of a melody puzzle game during the winter training period of the wind band and conducted internal playtests, which led to the launch of this little game on the day the training ends.
!<h1 Motivation>
The original vision is that everyone, regardless of experience, can explore, experience and create music up-close in the puzzles.
I’ve been solidly against the meritocracy in the art of music, feeling that there should not be a barrier to the natural language of humankind which everyone is soaked in. Whenever I see friends hold back, saying “I’m not qualified due to my illiteracy in music theory”, I get anxiously overwhelmed — there is no such thing as the need to learn that hard in order to speak! Thus to a large extent, Medle is a determined attempt to dispel this myth.
Aside from educational value, the process of guessing itself is like the composition and interpretation of music, being a trial-and-error process among infinite possibilities. What kind of aural and emotional experience will the chemical reactions between sounds yield? I hope that the puzzle game will lead more players to explore this question in their very own way, introducing them to this colourful world and inviting them to have fun in it. This is probably the most important prospect of this game!
!<h1 Gibberish>
The game was shared in <link https://closed.social/ closed.social> soon after its launch, where it received lots of good will as well as puzzle proposals. I was overjoyed that friends who nearly refrained from approaching the game as they “knew little about music” gradually feel more confident after a few days’ play. Later on, it gained a little popularity in the circle of friends and spread in WeChat Moments, received genuine compliments from friends around, and even saw a few forks with dedicated themes! It is such a joy to be enjoyed.
It does get bothering having to accumulate a bit of work every single day, but I am moved by puzzle proposals I receive and it is indeed delightful to have a steady reason to get immersed in music. I have seriously thought about inviting more friends to co-operate the game, but it was always delayed due to my procrastination. During the summer vacation I made an online message board for receiving puzzle proposals, but it never went live due to my perfectionism for interface design. The ways of submitting them are still clumsy until now…
Operational accidents are certainly not uncommon. Missing the puzzle timeline, being blocked by firewalls, etc. Medle now lives on a cloud distributed around the world and should be less vulnerable!
Will go on having fun with all! <kao ♡(*´∀｀*)人(*´∀｀*)♡>
